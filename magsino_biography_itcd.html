	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my unforgettable <b><i><u>Childhood memories</u></i></b> would be at my grandma's house.<sup><b>1</b></sup> When I was at nursery, classes for nursery is half-day, so in the afternoon my home was my grandma's house.<sup><b>2</b></sup> I still remember how it smells when you enter the gate.<sup><b>3</b></sup> I still remember how the smell of woods because it was built in the '80s, even now, I still smell the scent that house has, it still lingers in my nose.<sup><b>4</b></sup>
	
	<hr width="80%" size="2" color="#5F5C65" align="middle" NOSHADE>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tragic accident happened to her because she tripped on stairs that caused her to dislocate her hip, and she can't endure the pain she has so she passed away that time too.<sup><b>5</b></sup> Even years have passed by I can still feel her cold hand that she used to hold me in her arms.<sup><b>6</b></sup> Even I was so young at that time, I still remember everything that she did with me.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Even she's not with us anymore, I know she's at a good place and she is watching and guiding us from above.<sup><b>8</b></sup> 
	
	<hr width="80%" size="2" color="#5F5C65" align="middle" NOSHADE>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another memory of my childhood year too.<sup><b>9</b></sup> I think when I was 3 to 4 years old when my dad still serve for the Philippines.<sup><b>10</b></sup> One time when he got assigned to Jolo, Sulu.<sup><b>11</b></sup> That time in Sulu there were so many <abbr title="New Peoples Army">NPA's</abbr> and that place is like a warzone in Philippines.<sup><b>12</b></sup> But before he go to Sulu, when he was packing his things.<sup><b>13</b></sup> I still remember that I drew a stickman but it was my family, I can still remember that I drew it on folder and made it like it has a frame so it can stand.<sup><b>14</b></sup> I still have many memories of my childhood.<sup><b>15</b></sup> I was to naughty when I was a child, I know all of us gone through this stage.<sup><b>16</b></sup> I remember something that I did too.<sup><b>17</b></sup> It was afternoon and I invited my friends to my house, What we did there in memorable for us<sup><b>18</b></sup>. We fill our salas with water and block the water ways.<sup><b>19</b></sup> We swam in our salas with fishes from aquarium.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></p></p></div>

	<div align="justify">
	
	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have many memories of <b><i><u>Teenage years</u></i></b> because teenage years are the best years in one's life.<sup><b>1</b></sup> Because this is the peek where we can enjoy things that we like because the time that we have was so much advantage but we learn things in this peek of life too.<sup><b>2</b></sup> Teenage years are depressing because they are going through some of the biggest changes in their life.<sup><b>3</b></sup> Teens start high school and have to deal with being little in a school again.<sup><b>4</b></sup> Growing up is a difficult process, especially for individuals in their adolescent years.<sup><b>5</b></sup>
		Everyone who has gone through this process says that the years leading up to it have been some of the most awkward and weird of their lives.<sup><b>6</b></sup>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I studied in my Junior High School at <abbr title="Laguna College">LC</abbr> and it was far from my home, so every 5:30 in the morning.<sup><b>7</b></sup> I prepare myself so I won't be late for school.<sup><b>8</b></sup> I still remember every morning flag ceremonies, when boys still have haircut inspection.<sup><b>9</b></sup> I was so nervous that my hair will me check because I have more confidence for having long hair.<sup><b>10</b></sup> I built myself in these years.<sup><b>11</b></sup> So I can be prepared when things got complicated for me because this is where we need to think more than to do things.<sup><b>12</b></sup>I have so many memories of that years because so many things happened to me.<sup><b>13</b></sup>
		
	<hr width="80%" size="2" color="#5F5C65" align="middle" NOSHADE>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in this years will have so many lessons for us, this is where we meet friends, first love, first heartbreak.<sup><b>14</b></sup> In these years we especially need when to manage things that we need.<sup><b>15</b></sup> I still can't believe that my teenage years are done.<sup><b>16</b></sup> But even my if teenage years are done.<sup><b>17</b></sup> I enjoyed those years doing the things that I like.<sup><b>18</b></sup> Meeting people in that years helped me to grow.<sup><b>19</b></sup> Teenage years taught me that we also need to enjoy.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></p></p></div>

	<h2>&nbsp;COLLEGE YEARS</h2>

	<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i><u>College years</u></i></b> are still not the best year for me because I can't still go through any physical contact with my friends because of the Covid19, but if my Senior High School years.<sup><b>1</b></sup> I have great memories for that year, because I met a lot of mature people than in junior years.<sup><b>2</b></sup> When I was a Senior high, I was a varsity player in Letran in volleyball.<sup><b>3</b></sup> I have so a lot of experience in training, because that training was so intense that we were always hesitant to quit because of how hard it is.<sup><b>4</b></sup> But my team was full of pride because we think that this is for ourselves too, we train to be better.<sup><b>5</b></sup>
	
	<hr width="80%" size="2" color="#5F5C65" align="middle" NOSHADE>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I learned to be independent because when you go to college, especially, when it's far from your home you need to manage things because your parents won't be with you.<sup><b>6</b></sup> You need to practice yourself or understand other things because you need to manage your allowance, your clothes, and your sleeping routine.<sup><b>7</b></sup> This stage will help you to prepare for your future as well.<sup><b>8</b></sup> We know that in the pasts years.<sup><b>9</b></sup> Even if we enjoyed or had fun, we also need to be matured when it comes that we don't need some guidance from others.<sup><b>10</b></sup> With this set up like online class, for me we need to boost our confidence to help ourselves learn more skills.<sup><b>11</b></sup> We need to study or don't stop studying because this will help you for your future.<sup><b>12</b></sup>
	
	<hr width="80%" size="2" color="#5F5C65" align="middle" NOSHADE>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't experience a physical contact in our school.<sup><b>13</b></sup> I know that college life is completely different from school life, because you should the challenges seriously.sup><b>14</b></sup> But with this set up like online class it's easy to do reading and assignments in the online environment.<sup><b>15</b></sup> In college life, one gets a chance to make their own decisions.<sup><b>16</b></sup> In <abbr title="Junior High School">JHS</abbr> life, students can still enjoy and not make decisions on their own.<sup><b>17</b></sup> In <abbr title="Junior High School">JHS</abbr> you dont have limitations while on college life you need to limit yourself for enjoying things because you need to take this course seriously.<sup><b>18</b></sup> We go through a lot of changes when we enter college life.<sup><b>19</b></sup> It is a big transition if we compare it with <abbr title="Junior High School">JHS</abbr>.<sup><b>20</b></sup> It is a place where we get a little more mature than we were during school time.<sup><b>21</b></sup> It is an opportunity for a person to take the life the way he wants.<sup><b>22</b></sup></blockquote></p></div>
